            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PROPOSALS for PRINTING A Compleat HISTORY of ENGLAND: OR, THE Lives of all the Kings TO His Preſent MAJESTY.</head>
            <head type="sub">CONTAINING, A Faithful Relation of all <hi>Affairs of State,</hi> both <hi>Eccleſiaſtical and Civil,</hi> with Obſervations, ancient Inſcriptions, Coins and Medals, for Illuſtration thereof; and the Effiges of the Kings. Collected from the moſt Authentick Authors and Original Papers, by ſeveral Hands.</head>
            <p>IF Hiſtory be beſt ſupplied both with Delight and Inſtruction, from a Variety of Occurrences; there are few Nations better able to furniſh it than the Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi> We have had ſo many Changes, carried on by ſuch different Methods, and to ſo many ſeveral Ends, that if they were ſet in a true Light, we ſhould have little occaſion to look abroad for Examples, almoſt in any kind. But the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune is, What would be the great Ornament of our Hiſtory, if once finiſh'd, has been the main Diſcouragement from attempting it. We have not wanted Perſons of the greateſt Abilities, who, out of a Concern for the Publick, have ſet about it with the utmoſt Reſolution; but have been either ſurpriz'd by Death, or diverted by Buſineſs, or frighted by the growing Difficulties from undertaking the whole, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd themſelves to ſome particular part. The great Light of our Nation, Mr. <hi>CAMDEN,</hi> deſign'd it; and had as much reaſon to hope for Succeſs as any one: But tho' he had time enough before him, and greater Opportunities than the generality of Men are Maſters of, he fairly confeſſes, That after a little Progreſs, he found the Task too weighty, and ſo ſet about the Hiſtory of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> That ſingle Reign coſt him ſixteen Years Labour, tho' himſelf had been an Eye-witneſs of the greateſt part of it. 'Tis true, a General Hiſtory would not require ſuch a large account of every Reign; But the whole Body of our Old <hi>Hiſterians</hi> muſt be examin'd, the <hi>Records of the Kingdom</hi> conſulted, our Conſtitution throughly underſtood: And after all, this Maſs of Collections is to be digeſted into a Method and Style ſuitable to the Subject. And certainly here is full Employment for the Age of any one Man, let him begin as early as he pleaſes and ſet out with all the Advantages imaginable. <hi>Such is the Wiſdom of thoſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertakers, who would perſwade the World they are in earneſt, when they promiſe to run through all the Changes,</hi> from the Flood <hi>to this very Day, in the Compaſs of one poor Year.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the many Diſappointments which have already happen'd, and the multitude of Accidents (as, una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable Avocations, Sickeneſs, Death, and too often want of Reſolution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) which may inrerrupt ſuch a great Undertaking, gives us ſo little Proſpect of hoping for a <hi>Compleat Hiſtory</hi> by any ſuch way, that it may be a Piece of good Service to the Publick to fix upon another Method.</p>
            <p>'Tis in general, to ſupply the Inconveniences which attend one Man's Undertaking, by uniting the Labours of ſeveral; who, 'as they handl'd ſome ſingle part only, had better Opportunities of informing themſelves thorowly, and leſs Temptation to run it over ſuperficially. This (tho' it may come ſhort of the Perfection might be wiſh'd for) is certainly practicable, and ſeems the moſt accurate that can be reaſonably expected. Such as it is, we freely ſubmit it to the Judgment of the Learned, hoping that the <hi>Authors</hi> which have ſingly had ſo much Eſteem, may be at leaſt of equal Value, and be as kindly receiv'd, when drawn into one Body.</p>
